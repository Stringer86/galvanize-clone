This is a boilerplate for projects that have react and webpack.
--
Usage

```
$ git clone https://github.com/voxelsdev/react-webpack-boilerplate.git
$ mv -a react-webpack-boilerplate/. whateveryouwantittobenamed/
$ rm -rf react-webpack-boilerplate/
$ cd whateveryouwantittobenamed/
$ npm i
```

Then just go into the src file, and add / edit components.

This project has css, image, and js loaders, which I would reccommend taking a look at those npm pages for more information.

Make sure you have the latest versions of everything, too. (node, pg, and whatnot).

Make an app!
